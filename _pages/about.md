  (Website WIP)

Greetings! My name is Mark Gjuraj, or Mark G, if that's easier 😆. I've heard it all, so give it your best shot!

I'm an aspiring data professional looking for a full-time opportunity. I'm targetting Data Science, Data Analyst, and Business Analyst roles, but would be open to discussing any role aligned with my skillset and/or experience.

Here's a bit about myself. For more information, my resume is available in the header! Thanks for stopping by.

## Overview

👨‍💻 As a Yale University *cum laude* graduate with a Bachelor of Arts in Statistics and Data Science, I have a robust theoretical and practical foundation in statistics, data analysis, machine learning, deep learning, and programming (e.g. Python, R, SQL). 
  
🌎 At Global-e, I did data analysis for the Merchant Operations team, actively supporting and optimizing the Shopify Markets Pro (now Managed Markets) product &mdash; an international e-commerce solution &mdash; as it transitioned from Early Access to General Availability.
  
📈 At Global-e, I managed a suite of analytical dashboards and leadership-facing reports to foster data transparency and facilitate data-driven decision making across the company (via SQL, Excel, Google Sheets, GitHub, Jira). 
  
🌉 At Global-e, I served as a bridge between highly technical engineers and less-technical, operational minds, routinely collaborating with internal and external partners to achieve cross-functional goals and ensure product alignment.
